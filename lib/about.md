# About this Directory

This directory consists of all the third party 
libraries that are needed by our project. 

The source code for the third party 
libraries is not directly copied into this directory,
but is rather mapped here by means of
[Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
