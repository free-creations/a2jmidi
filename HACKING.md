# Coding style

We use mainly the "llvm" coding style, with some minor deviations.
See .clang-format and .clang-tidy for the details.

# External libraries
Libraries that are not so common in the Ubuntu repositories are imported as source code  
by means of
[Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
This is not without problems.
